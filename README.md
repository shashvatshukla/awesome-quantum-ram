Quantum Random Access Memory. Vittorio Giovannetti, Seth Lloyd, and Lorenzo Maccone. 2008. PRL. 4 pages. 

Defines QRAM. Presents the standard fanout architecture for RAM and proposes the bucket-brigade architecture for RAM and QRAM. The bucket-brigade architecture exponentially reduces the number of two-qubit interactions between "active" (not wait state) states, and so are advantageous for error models where only "active" states experience noise. A photonic implementation is discussed.
